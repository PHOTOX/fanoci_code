# fanoci_code
the Fano-CI code for the computation of decay widths of Fano resonances


### Changes, updates and more :)

2016

----

All signs of the matrix elements are corrected 
New input and excitation Fano-CI included

May 12, 2017

----

Partial decay widths implemented
Files fort.100x contain the partial widths for each 2h CI state !works!
